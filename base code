		<p class="sansserif">I'm am currently on a Fulbright Fellowship to Luxembourg where I serve
as an English teaching assistant to a high school in Esch-Sur-Alzette as well as the
University of Luxembourg. Beyond that, I'm a young professional looking to gain experience
in brand-imaging, creative strategy, and developing business solutions to increase market
efficiency. I have helped professional services companies with publicity, placing several
Central Florida attorneys in outfits such as the Wall Street Journal, the Orlando
Sentinel, and the Miami Herald. In addition, I doubled production for an AARP Jacksonville
radio show by developing a more efficient source-to-air information gathering process. I
also resourced a handful of talented potential employees through a self-directed marketing
plan for AARP Florida. Developing creative solutions for all types of business processes,
from customer service to data-processing and analysis, is my preferred workplace
challenge. In finding these solutions, clear, concise and enthusiastic communication
inspires me. In the office, people have called me insightful, bright, and fun. In general,
I tend to bring a sense of group engagement to my projects. Naturally, my ideal work
environment is in a group of people smarter than me. In my free time, I enjoying reading
philosophy and improving my French.</p>
